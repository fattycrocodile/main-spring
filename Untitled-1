goal: drafts don't have a stable message ID because the participants can be changed.
drafts DO have a client ID but it's now the headerMessageId

ONLY c++ can write the draft to the database. 
- there's really no harm in having a draft never saved to the database at all
  until the first time it's closed or saved or popped out
- EXCEPT that it's not even possible to get it into the UI without saving it...
  will need to send to c++ to save immediately, even if just locally.


possible prereq:

- right now, C++ connects to JS. What if JS connected to C++?
  + each window connects to three sync servers
  + to ensure deltas aren't missed...c++ needs to wait until they all connect? hmm...

current:
  + three sync clients connect to main window
    + main window uses electron IPC to relay events to the other windows
