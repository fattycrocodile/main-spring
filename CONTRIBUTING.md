# Filing an Issue

Thanks for checking out Nylas Mail! If you have a feature request, be sure to check out the [open source roadmap](http://trello.com/b/hxsqB6vx/n1-open-source-roadmap). If someone has already requested
the feature you have in mind, you can upvote the card on Trelloâ€”to keep things organized, we
often close feature requests on GitHub after creating Trello cards.

If you've found a bug, try searching for similars issue before filing a new one. Please include
the version of Nylas Mail you're using, the platform you're using (Mac / Windows / Linux), and the
type of email account. (Gmail, Outlook 365, etc.)

# Pull requests

We require all authors sign our [Contributor License
Agreement](https://www.nylas.com/cla.html) before pull requests (even
minor ones) can be accepted. (It's similar to other projects, like NodeJS
Meteor, or React). I'm really sorry, but Legal made us do it.

### Commit Format

We decided to not impose super strict commit guidelines on the community.

We're trusting you to be thoughtful, responsible, committers.

We do have a few heuristics:

- Keep commits fairly isolated. Don't jam lots of different functionality
  in 1 squashed commit. `git bisect` and `git cherry-pick` should still be
  reasonable things to do.
- Keep commits fairly significant. DO `squash` all those little file
  changes and "fixmes". Don't make it difficult to browse our history.
  Play the balance between this idea and the last point. If a commit
  doesn't deserve your time to write a long thoughtful message about, then
  squash it.
- Be hyper-descriptive in your commit messages. I care less about what
  you did (I can read the code), **I want to know WHY you did it**. Put
  that in the commit body (not the subject). Itemize the major semantic
  changes that happened.
- Read "[How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)" if you haven't already (but don't be too prescriptivist about it!)
