# Configuration

This document outlines configuration options which aren't exposed via N1's
preferences interface but may be useful.

## Other Config Options

- `core.workspace.interfaceZoom`: If you'd like the N1 interface to be smaller or larger, this option allows you to scale the UI globally. (Default: 1)
