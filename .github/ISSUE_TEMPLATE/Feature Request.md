<!--
Thanks for taking the time to file a feature request!
-->

##### Describe your feature request:

##### Does this feature exist in another mail client or tool you use?

##### Are there any related feature requests?

<!-- Try searching for both open and closed issues here: https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/issues?q=is%3Aenhancement. Keep in mind that email features are often described differently on different platforms. (Conversations == threads, shortcuts == hotkeys, etc)

Upvoting an existing feature request is MUCH better than submitting a new one - it often takes a while for them to be merged and we use issue upvotes to prioritize development!
 -->

##### Is the request related to a specific email provider (Gmail, Exchange, etc.)?
