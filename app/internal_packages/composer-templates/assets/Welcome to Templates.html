Hey, <code class="var empty">{{First Name}}</code>!
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Templates! This feature makes it easy to create preset email templates with
<code class="var empty">{{variables}}</code> (in double curly braces) and use them to 
quickly reply to emails.
<br/>
<br/>
When you send your message, the highlighting is always removed so the recipient
never sees it.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!
<br/>
