**Leaving Nylas Mail? Mailspring is a new version by one of the original authors. It's faster, leaner, and shipping today!** Mailspring is an open-source mail client built on the modern web with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/). It is designed to be extensible, so it's easy to create new experiences and workflows around email. Want to learn more? Check out the [full documentation](https://Foundry376.github.io/Mailspring/).

## Contributing

Mailspring's UI is entirely open-source and pull requests and contributions are welcome! There are three ways to contribute: building a plugin, building a theme, and submitting pull requests to the project itself.

### Building A Plugin

Plugins lie at the heart of Mailspring and give it its powerful features. Building your own plugins allows you to integrate the app with other tools, experiment with new workflows, and more. Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://Foundry376.github.io/Mailspring/) to write your first plugin in five minutes. To create your own theme, go to our [Theme Starter guide](https://github.com/nylas/N1-theme-starter).

A plugin "store" like the Chrome Web Store is coming soon, and will make it easy for other users to discover plugins you create.

### Building a Theme

The Mailspring user interface is styled using CSS, which means it's easy to modify and extend. Mailspring comes stock with a few beautiful themes, and there are many more which have been built by community developers. To start creating a theme, [clone the theme starter](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-mail-theme-starter)!

### Contributing to Mailspring Core

Pull requests are always welcome - check out [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about setting up the development environment, running tests locally, and submitting pull requests.
