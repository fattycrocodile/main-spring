**Hello! I'm one of the original authors of Nylas Mail and this is a significant fork of the app which completely replaces JavaScript mail sync with a C++ core built on Mailcore2. Unfortunately, it's not ready for use - check back soon!**

![Merani Screenshot](https://github.com/Foundry376/Merani/raw/master/screenshots/hero_graphic_mac%402x.png)

High level Goals:
---

- Replace JavaScript mail sync (client-sync package) and the Electron "worker window" with a new, high performance codebase written in C++ and based on Mailcore2. Make the Electron application just the UI layer.
  + One C++ process per email account.
  + C++ and JS communicate via the child process stdin/stdout streams.
  + JS application queues tasks *but has read-only access to the database.*
  + JS application should not install timers or wake /at all/ when idle. 0% battery impact when idle.
- Improve performance of the thread list and composer contenteditable.
- Make windows open faster by just having less code.
- Bring back mail rules.


Technical Breakdown of Changes:
---
- Activity window and client-sync package removed.
- MailsyncBridge, a new singleton in the main window, manages C++ sync workers.
- DatabaseStore no longer provides an interface to write to the database from JavaScript and the following have moved to C++:
  + Database setup and migration
  + Search indexing of threads/contacts
  + Delta processing
  + Task processing
- Heavy node modules removed:
  + Bluebird
  + Q
  + request
  + etc...
- Package manager has been completely rewritten to be more performant and load packages in two phases.
- Delta serialization / deserialization performance has been dramatically improved by removing the JSON reviver.
- FileDownloadStore / FileUploadStore have been merged into AttachmentStore


Future Features:
----
- Receipts
- Templates with per-template performance tracking
- Groups
- Files
